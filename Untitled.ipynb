       " <p>A lot of investors want to get in on cryptocurrency stocks today, but the prices are sky high. As of writing, Bitcoin trades at about $61,000! Just one of these shares would take up almost all of your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) room. So, maybe it’s better to look at other options.</p>,\n",
       " <p>I’m going to cover the three best cryptocurrency stocks to buy today, with prices that are well below thousands of dollars. On top of that, each provides far less volatility, so you don’t put all that risk in one basket.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>HIVE </strong><strong>Blockchain Technologies </strong>(TSX:HIVE) mines and sells cryptocurrency and continues to grow at a rapid pace. I don’t just mean in share price, though shares are up 1,185% in the last year alone.</p>,\n",
       " <p>What I mean is that the company is providing even more safe storage space for cryptocurrency. In fact, the company most recently purchased a data centre in New Brunswick. On top of that, the company recently made a share trade with DeFi Technologies, 10 million of DeFi for four million of HIVE. The trade gives HIVE stock a strategic stake in the company, with a focus on Ethereum developments. Management believes significant fees will be brought in for mining Ethereum.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Yet shares still trade at around $3.40; the stock has dropped in half with the pullback in tech stocks. So, if you’re into the best cryptocurrency stocks, this blockchain company is a stellar buy on the TSX today.</p>,\n",
       " <p>But let’s say you want more exposure to actual Bitcoin. I would then highly recommend <strong>Purpose Bitcoin ETF </strong>(TSX:BTCC.B). The company boasts being the world’s first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and can fit right into your TFSA at the share price of about $9 as of writing.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The company is incredibly new, so there’s not much data to go on. However, if you’re looking for a safe way to manage Bitcoin, this is the closest you’ll get. The company is a pure play on Bitcoin, with 100% of its portfolio in Bitcoin. So, it’s like holding Bitcoin itself, but way cheaper. And it’s growing rapidly, most recently passing $1 billion in assets under management after only one month on the TSX.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Similar to HIVE stock, <strong>Galaxy Digital Holdings </strong>(TSX:GLXY) is an asset management firm operating primarily with digital assets and blockchain technology. It’s like owning any asset company, but, in this case, there is a focus on cryptocurrency.</p>,\n",
       " <p>For those seeking the future of cryptocurrency, this is exactly where you’ll want to be. Just like any asset firm, there’s a management fee. But that fee is a bargain if it means you have experts continuously finding new ways of investing in cryptocurrency. As long as cryptocurrency is around, Galaxy stock will continue to make money. That’s why it’s one of the best cryptocurrency stocks out there.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This is the highest share price of the three, but it still only about $30 as of writing. And shares have grown by almost 3,000% in the last year alone! So, if you want to bet hard on the growth of cryptocurrency, this is, again, one of the safest ways to see your shares rise in the years to come.</p>,\n",
       " <p>You don’t have to bet on new, expensive, or even risky stocks when it comes to cryptocurrency. The best cryptocurrency stocks on the TSX today are those that provide exposure to multiple areas. Rather than putting everything in one basket, diversify with these stocks at much more affordable share prices.</p>,\n",

       " <p class=\"M(0) C($summaryColor) Fz(14px) Lh(1.43em) LineClamp(3,60px)\">BEN STANSALLWho could possibly have foreseen this happening?This week’s in-person G7 meeting in London has quickly descended into chaos after two Indian delegates tested positive for the coronavirus. The India group was granted an exemption to Britain’s quarantine rules upon its arrival—despite the massive virus surge in their home country—but all its delegates have now been told to go into self-isolation.Ahead of the meeting, the British government promised “COVID-secure talks” with the foreign ministers of the G7 countries, as well as special guests from India, Australia, South Korea, and South Africa. It was intended as a trial for the full-scale G7 summit in England next month, which is expected to be Joe Biden’s first foreign trip as president.But the entire Indian contingent has now been forced to self-isolate and will attend the rest of this week’s meetings virtually from their hotel rooms. According to Sky News, India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday, but he was not one of the two Indian delegates to have tested positive.The Indian foreign minister posted a photo of himself at a Zoom meeting later Wednesday with the caption: “So far, yet so near.”A cyber participation at the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. So far, yet so near. pic.twitter.com/kjxqi5mwNx— Dr. S. Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) May 5, 2021 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked Wednesday if it was a mistake to hold the in-person meeting when the pandemic is still raging out of control in some parts of the world. He said: “I think it’s very important to try to continue as much business as you can as a government. We have a very important relationship with India, with our G7 partners.”The British PM went on: “What’s happened is the individuals concerned, they’re all isolating now. I will be seeing the Indian foreign minister later on this afternoon but that will be a Zoom exchange.”But the near-inevitability of positive cases recorded at the meeting will raise more questions about whether it’s sensible to hold international in-person events before the pandemic is under control globally. The full G7 summit is set to take place in Cornwall, England on June 11-13.The positive cases at the London G7 meeting came during an unprecedented coronavirus surge in India. There were 382,315 new cases recorded on Wednesday, and, according to Reuters, the country has recorded over 300,000 cases every day for the past two weeks.The British opposition leader, the Labour Party’s Sir Keir Starmer, said on Wednesday: “It’s a reminder of how vigilant we need to be about our borders—we've been challenging the government on this for some months. Let’s get to the bottom of how this happened, we cannot have a repeat.”The meeting was billed by the U.K. government as “an opportunity to show how the world’s biggest democracies work together to ensure equitable access to vaccines [and] build back better from the pandemic.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Stop &amp; Shop will donate additional funding to the campaign, bringing the total donation to the hospitals to $4.25 million. The campaign, which ran throughout the month of March, allowed customers to round-up their purchases to the nearest dollar or donate an additional $1, $3 or $5 when shopping in store and online. In New York, New Jersey, and Fairfield and New Haven counties in Connecticut, customer donations supported MSK Kids, Memorial Sloan Kettering’s pediatric oncology program. Donations made north of New Haven in Connecticut, and across Massachusetts and Rhode Island, were directed to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 100% of all donations benefitted the two hospitals, both leaders in the fight against pediatric cancer worldwide. “Stop &amp; Shop has generous and caring customers, and the results of this year’s Help Cure Childhood Cancer campaign are evidence of that,” shared Gordon Reid, President of Stop &amp; Shop. “We are proud to donate additional funds to help ensure the hospitals can provide the best possible care and treatment for their young patients and their families.” This year marked the 20th anniversary of Stop &amp; Shop’s partnership with MSK Kids at Memorial Sloan Kettering. To celebrate, Stop &amp; Shop donated $20,000 worth of gift cards to MSK’s FOOD (Food to Overcome Outcomes Disparities) Program, which aims to alleviate food insecurity and increase awareness of how hunger impacts a patient’s ability to fight cancer. The gift cards will allow FOOD to purchase the necessary provisions patients need. MSK Kids, Memorial Sloan Kettering’s pediatric oncology program, is dedicated to all children, young adults, and families facing childhood cancer. With specialized expertise and care focused on the individual child, MSK Kids is the largest pediatric oncology program in the United States. As pioneers in pediatric research, MSK Kids physicians and scientists work hard to develop and deliver more effective strategies to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure childhood cancer—for patients at MSK Kids, and for those everywhere. “The commitment of Stop &amp; Shop’s entire community—leadership, associates, and customers—over the last 20 years has been critical to our work at MSK Kids. Once again, this generous support will allow us to provide outstanding care for patients today, while investing in research to improve outcomes for pediatric cancers. On behalf of all of us at MSK Kids, I thank Stop &amp; Shop for its longstanding partnership,” said Andrew Kung, Chair, Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering. The Stop &amp; Shop Pediatric Brain Tumor Clinic at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is a world-renowned destination for children with malignant and nonmalignant brain tumors. Several initiatives, including the Stop &amp; Shop Family Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Outcomes Clinic (also known as EmPOWER) and the Adolescent and Young Adult Brain Tumor Clinic, encourage and enable patients and their families to lead the healthiest, most fulfilling lives following brain tumor treatment. “We are so grateful that Stop and Shop, our largest corporate donor, has supported our Pediatric Brain Tumor Clinic and research program for over two decades.

       "\"Facebook's oversight board upholds site's decision to suspend Donald Trump's account A lot of investors want to get in on cryptocurrency stocks today, but the prices are sky high. As of writing, Bitcoin trades at about $61,000! Just one of these shares would take up almost all of your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) room. So, maybe it’s better to look at other options. I’m going to cover the three best cryptocurrency stocks to buy today, with prices that are well below thousands of dollars. On top of that, each provides far less volatility, so you don’t put all that risk in one basket. HIVE Blockchain Technologies (TSX:HIVE) mines and sells cryptocurrency and continues to grow at a rapid pace. I don’t just mean in share price, though shares are up 1,185% in the last year alone. What I mean is that the company is providing even more safe storage space for cryptocurrency. In fact, the company most recently purchased a data centre in New Brunswick. On top of that, the company recently made a share trade with DeFi Technologies, 10 million of DeFi for four million of HIVE. The trade gives HIVE stock a strategic stake in the company, with a focus on Ethereum developments. Management believes significant fees will be brought in for mining Ethereum. Yet shares still trade at around $3.40; the stock has dropped in half with the pullback in tech stocks. So, if you’re into the best cryptocurrency stocks, this blockchain company is a stellar buy on the TSX today. But let’s say you want more exposure to actual Bitcoin. I would then highly recommend Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCC.B). The company boasts being the world’s first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and can fit right into your TFSA at the share price of about $9 as of writing. The company is incredibly new, so there’s not much data to go on. However, if you’re looking for a safe way to manage Bitcoin, this is the closest you’ll get. The company is a pure play on Bitcoin, with 100% of its portfolio in Bitcoin. So, it’s like holding Bitcoin itself, but way cheaper. And it’s growing rapidly, most recently passing $1 billion in assets under management after only one month on the TSX. Similar to HIVE stock, Galaxy Digital Holdings (TSX:GLXY) is an asset management firm operating primarily with digital assets and blockchain technology. It’s like owning any\""

Keeping your finger on the pulse of how the fintech landscape can help guide your investment. Who better to learn from than the influencers who dominate the industry? Let\\'s take a look at a few of the youngest fintech influencers whose products and companies change the world.\\xa0 Vitaly Dmitriyevich \"Vitalik\" Buterin is a programmer best known for creating the cryptocurrency Ethereum. Introduced in 2014, Ethereum (and its widely traded coin, Ether) is an open-source blockchain project that allows users to build decentralized applications. These \"DApps\" have been put into use in a wide range of industries, including gaming, gambling and banking. The value of Ethereum has soared by more than 130% in 2021 alone, as investors and developers explore the cryptocurrency\\'s potential in the realm of decentralized finance. Ethereum currently has a total market capitalization of more than $215 billion and with the recent launch of Ethereum\\'s EIP 1559 upgrade, it\\'s possible that investors could see even more explosive growth from the coin in the future.\\xa0  As the 32-year-old mastermind behind Stripe, Patrick Collison has already solidified his fintech legacy. It appears that he has no plans to slow down in the future. Stripe is an American-Irish software as a service (SaaS) company innovating the way that users make online payments. Small business owners use Stripe to process payments more securely online and create their own application programming interfaces that they can integrate into their websites directly.\\xa0 Source: JD Lasica via Wikimedia Currently recognized as one of the main competitors to PayPal, Stripe has recently launched its own line of fraud-detection software called \"Radar.\" In 2020, Stripe had a turnover of about $2 trillion. Collison and his brother will work at the helm with a controlling majority should the company decide to take steps to go public.\\xa0  Very few beginner investors can afford the assistance of a professional financial advisor. Jon Stein is the mind behind Betterment, a financial service provider offering affordable robo-advising services with low, accessible',\n",
       "  'Like other blockchains, Ethereum has a native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH).\\xa0ETH is digital money. If you’ve heard of\\xa0Bitcoin, ETH has many of the same features. It is purely digital, and can be sent to anyone anywhere in the world instantly. The supply of ETH isn’t controlled by any government or company – it is decentralized, and it is scarce. People all over the world use ETH to make payments, as a store of value, or as collateral. The latest news about Ethereum mostly concerns the move to Serenity the last post-development phase of Ethereum as well as changing Ether mining’s concept from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake in order to reduce the power cost of the process. Bitcoin is the first peer-to-peer digital currency, also known as cryptocurrency. It is famous for its decentralized transactions, meaning that there is no central governing body operating it, such as a central bank. Bitcoin News will help you to get the latest information about what is happening in the market. Cryptocurrency adoption has gotten a new dimension now that Yahoo Finance has integrated the buying and selling of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC) on its platform. At the moment, Ripple’s XRP, Stellar XLM, Bitcoin Cash and a host of others do not have buy and sell options on the platform. A crypto enthusiast, Pompiano who made this revelation was elated saying the cryptocurrency adoption virus has just started. “You can now buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin on Yahoo Finance. THE VIRUS IS SPREADING.” This is no doubt a giant stride for the cryptocurrency community as observers have posited on several occasions that crypto acceptance in all strata will result in massive price increase and not the Bitcoin ETF been campaigned for in recent time. Data used on the platform is pulled from CryptoCompare. Meanwhile, it is still surprising while Ripple and Bitcoin Cash which rank ahead of Litecoin were not included. \\xa0With the latest development, there is hope for crypto lovers that there is light at the end of the tunnel, but some are displeased for the one-sidedness of Yahoo Finance which failed',\n",
       "  'In April 2020, ethereum was wallowing in the receding ripples of a three-year market downturn. Having reached a peak of nearly $1,200 in early 2018, the cryptocurrency was dragged down to below $100 as the rising market wave crashed in spectacular style. But over the last 12 months, the tide has well and truly turned. Buffeted by a buoyant market and a resurgent bitcoin, ethereum has risen beyond its previous peak to hit a series of all-time highs in 2021. On Thursday, a new record was broken as ethereum reached $2,797 – representing a 1,300 per cent price increase since this time last year. One analyst claimed this week that “a ride to $5,000 is imminent”. >>Follow The Independent’s latest cryptocurrency market news live The latest gains are even more impressive when compared with those of bitcoin. The world’s first cryptocurrency has seen its own record highs in 2021, but they have been dwarfed – in percentage terms at least – by those seen by its less famous cousin. Ethereum has outperformed bitcoin by a factor of three-to-one, and now has a market cap roughly one third its size. In April 2021, ethereum’s overall value was just over one tenth of bitcoin’s. And while ethereum is cresting, bitcoin is experiencing a relatively severe slump, having lost nearly a quarter of its value since achieving a new record high earlier this month. So what’s brought about this change in fortunes? One reason often cited by by crypto experts is ethereum’s underlying technology, which allows it to be of far greater utility in the emerging industry of decentralised finance (DeFi). Ethereum was created in 2013 in order to use the blockchain – the revolutionary online ledger system introduced and popularised by bitcoin – in an entirely new way. While bitcoin uses the blockchain to support payments and act as a store of value, ethereum was designed to act as a software platform that can enable smart contracts for any asset or application without need for a third party. While bitcoin offers to decentralise finance, ethereum offers to decentralise the entire internet. This',\n",
       "  'Ethereum is now trading 28.53% lower than it was at the turn of the month after succumbing to bearish sell pressure over the past week. The world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $342 after bouncing from the $316 level of support over the weekend. The $316 level has been mapped out after a support/resistance flip at the end of July, which eventually paved the way for a period of bullish continuation that saw Ethereum reach as high as $490. While holding above $316 will be key, in the short term Ethereum is showing signs of weakness with the four-hour 50 EMA crossing the 200 EMA to the downside for the first time since June. The velocity and efficiency of the recent break down in price can only be attributed to the lack of long-term belief in DeFi projects like Sushi and Yearn Finance. ETHUSD chart by TradingView Over the weekend Sushi, a yield farming protocol, crashed by 80% as the lead developer controversially liquidated his Sushi tokens for $15 million before transferring ownership of the project to FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The token, which reached an all-time high of $11 on September 1, is now worth $2.73 after bouncing from a gruelling low of $1.21. This was a clear demonstration of the fragility of the rising sector, most of which is built on Ethereum’s blockchain. If more projects begin to go the way of Sushi or Yam Finance, Ethereum’s brand will be damaged among investors who have lost capital in DeFi. A key level of resistance to look out for if Ethereum can recover in the next few days is $366, while a potential target of $284 may also be on the cards if $316 breaks.

On Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Bitcoin was selling at $27,248 at around 6 a.m. GMT. It also posted a 24-hour high of $27,555. From $26,000 on Saturday, Bitcoin has gained nearly 11% in value. The total market volume exceeded half a trillion, reaching $507.1 billion. Its market volume has jumped by $46 billion in the last 24 hours. Binance, sharing a statement on its Twitter account, said Bitcoin hit $24,000 on Dec. 24th, $25,000 on the 25th, $26,000 on the 26th and $27,000 on the 27th and that the cryptocurrency will \"continue (the trend).\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Bitcoin smashed through $20,000 for the first time on Dec. 16, it\\'s then-highest ever. It has gained more than 170% this year, buoyed by demand from larger investors attracted to its potential for quick gains, purported resistance to inflation and expectations it will become a mainstream payment method. Bitcoin\\'s blistering rally has seen a massive flow of coin to North America from East Asia, fueled by a hunger for bitcoin among bigger and compliance-wary U.S. investors. The rally in bitcoin, which some investors have seen as a potential safe haven, has coincided with spot gold\\'s drop in recent months. \\n\\n                    Please\\n                     click \\n                    to read our informative text prepared pursuant to the Law on the Protection of Personal Data No. 6698 and to get information about the\\n                    cookies\\n                    used on our website',\n",
       "  \"Tesla CEO Elon Musk's act of tagging the world’s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin in his Twitter biography caused it to soar as much as 14% to a two-week high. Musk wrote simply “#bitcoin” in his biography on the social media site. The cryptocurrency was trading at $37,800 as of 9:36 a.m. GMT. On Jan. 11, Bitcoin tumbled 20% in its sharpest fall since March. It lost a fifth of its value, dropping down to $30,500. The billionaire entrepreneur, followed by 43.7 million Twitter users, has a history of making market-moving comments on the site.

       "  'Coinbase\\'s post Thursday did not speculate on timing, but the company stands to be one of the most eagerly anticipated IPOs of 2021. IPOs have raised more than $160 billion this year on U.S. exchanges, according to The Wall Street Journal. Sixty-three companies debuted listings in December, raising more than $23 billion, according to Bloomberg data. DoorDash, on its first day of trading last week, closed at 86% above its initial price. Airbnb last week began its first-ever day of trading at $148 despite being valued at $68 at IPO. Beyond this week\\'s high-water mark in Bitcoin\\'s value, the crypto space has seen a warming trend this year as businesses have shown more acceptance of the once-fringe investment. PayPal said in October it would let U.S. account holders buy, sell and hold cryptocurrency in their PayPal digital wallets and use digital coins to pay for purchases starting early next year. JPMorgan Chase this spring said it extended banking services to Coinbase and fellow crypto exchange Gemini. Other institutions such as Northern Trust, Standard Chartered and Fidelity are exploring crypto custody, American Banker reported\\xa0Wednesday. And a number of companies over the past few months — notably, MicroStrategy, Square and MassMutual — have plowed millions of dollars in spare cash in Bitcoin. \"It is a watershed moment for the asset class, both as a form of legitimization, and by providing a way for investors to bet on the crypto industry without betting on a specific asset,\" Kyle Samani, co-founder of Multicoin Capital, told Bloomberg. Samani is an investor in Coinbase. Coinbase, which reportedly counts about 35 million users, was founded in 2012 by former Airbnb engineer Brian Armstrong and former Goldman Sachs trader Fred Ehrsam. New York\\'s Department of Financial Services granted the company a BitLicense in 2017, and the platform is now licensed to operate in 44 states and Washington, D.C. It\\'s also accessible in more than 100 countries outside the U.S. The company has a history of keeping its finances close to the vest.

It even adds a comments section for Yahoo’s many trolls to spew off. Beyond just checking how the cryptocurrency markets are doing generally, Yahoo is also starting to cooperate with companies in the industry to give users direct access to their data. Yesterday Coinbase announced that its users can now view their balances directly on Yahoo Finance’s iOS and Android applications. The company commented: “This integration is yet another sign of large consumer brands responding to increasing demand from consumers for digital currencies.

       "  'La criptomoneda más popular, Bitcoin, atraviesa una pronunciada caída en su valor este domingo, lo que provocó una conducta similar en otros activos digitales, que tuvieron pérdidas de hasta el 25%. El esperado debut de Coinbase en Wall Street, se había percibido para el mercado financiero como un impulso a un aumento en el valor de las criptomonedas, pero también, hay un costado negativo como lo es quedar al alcance de las regulaciones anti-lavado. Bitcoin, la cripto más cotizada del mundo, durante este domingo atraviesa una ola de ventas que la hizo perder en pocas horas casi USD 8.000 de valor. A partir de esta caída abrupta, el valor del Bitcoin se ubica por debajo de USD 55.000, luego de haber superado un récord diario de 61.300 dólares. Según ha informado Yahoo Finance, Bitcoin ha perdido hasta un 15% de su valor, la caída diaria más pronunciada desde febrero pasado. Pero el fenómeno no se agota allí, sino que también tiene impacto sobre otras cripto y divisas sobre los cuales los usuarios tienen inversiones o tenían planificado invertir. La caída de Bitcoin, impacta negativamente sobre las restantes criptomonedas. Ethereum, la segunda en capitalización de un mercado (con aproximadamente un cuarto del valor de Bitcoin) llegó a caer 17%, hasta recortar su pérdida a un 13 por ciento. Y Litecoin, la novena del ranking de las criptomonedas de mayor circulación y capitalización, caía nada menos que 24 por ciento. ¡También te puede interesar! \\xa0',\n",
       "  '(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Bitcoin’s true believers are taking a victory lap after the cryptocurrency’s fresh all-time high of almost $20,000. “Onward and upward we go to the moon!” tweeted Tyler Winklevoss. “All governments, [financial services] and corporations will soon be mining Bitcoin to guarantee their own supply,” echoed Bitcoin advocate Charlie Shrem. That appears to be true of the Venezuelan army, at least. But is this new record going to convert an often-skeptical financial sector, at least beyond hedge funds and strategists who see Bitcoin as a Covid-19 safe haven? Not everyone is convinced. Last month, as the cryptocurrency hit $18,000 for the first time since 2018, Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said he hadn’t changed his mind since he called Bitcoin a fraud during its 2017 bubble. “We’re a believer in cryptocurrency, properly regulated and properly backed,” he said, adding, “Bitcoin’s kind of different, and that’s not my cup of tea.” Dimon’s stance ultimately reflects the mood inside bulge-bracket banks that have been dipping their toes in crypto waters. Forged during the 2008 financial crisis as an artificially scarce, cryptographically secure way to bypass traditional finance, Bitcoin won’t be viewed as an existential threat to the banking system just because its price is soaring. But it won’t be ignored either. Rather it will be seen as a spur toward a more digital, regulator-friendly post-Covid payments future. We’ve seen big banks seek to make money from Bitcoin without handling it directly, reflecting fairly limited client demand and a lack of regulatory clarity. That’s still the preferred option. Morgan Stanley began clearing cash-settled Bitcoin futures in 2018, while JPMorgan this year adopted crypto exchanges Coinbase Inc. and the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini Trust Co. as corporate-banking clients. Bolder proposals such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s bid to open a crypto trading desk never really got anywhere. The long list of risks highlighted by the Bank for International Settlements, from money laundering and terrorist finance to reputation, might have something to do with it. A survey of financial assets between 2010 and 2019 on the Bank of England’s staff blog found',\n",

Bryan Routledge, Associate Professor of Finance at the Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down how Bitcoin rallied to record levels this year and the outlook for crypto in 2021. - Bitcoin at a record once again. It touched above 28,000 overnight. And it has had quite a run thus far in 2020. Hasn't had the end pullback that we saw, for example, in 2017. Let's talk more about what could happen next for Bitcoin as well as for the bigger cryptocurrency complex. Brian Rutledge is joining us now. He's an Associate Professor of Finance at Carnegie Mellon University Tepper School of Business. He has written a lot about cryptocurrency, but about blockchain as well. And it's actually there, Brian, that I want to begin because as Myles my co-host has pointed out frequently, the blockchain conversation is definitely not as prominent now as it was in 2017. The focus has really come in on Bitcoin and its rise. Do you think that that's sort of a mistaken perception? Do you think that there is still-- I mean, is-- is blockchain out there? Is-- how much is it being used? And what's sort of the use case as we move forward? BRIAN RUTLEDGE: Wow. OK. Lots packed in there. I think the-- the thing-- the thing to appreciate about Bitcoin and its rise in price-- I mean, 28,000 is remarkable. 3,000 was remarkable for Bitcoin in the sense it is built on blockchain technology. And so I think the fact that you're not talking about it is, in some sense, an acknowledgment that blockchain technology is effective. So it is big dollars that are in Bitcoin that are built on this underlying-- underlying blockchain technology of competitive decentralized recordkeeping. And if you had asked me in 2013 if this was going to be viable, I certainly wouldn't have said yes. And so I think the-- some of the price of Bitcoin is a bit of a mystery in the sense of why it\",\n",
       "  'Although analysts warned that it is an \"economic side show\" and a poor hedge against a fall in stock prices, Bitcoin touched a market value of $1 trillion as it hit yet another record high on Friday. The world\\'s most popular cryptocurrency jumped to an all-time high above $54,000, setting it on course for a weekly jump of more than 11%. It has surged roughly 64% so far this month and was last up 5.5% at $54,405. Bitcoin\\'s gains have been fueled by signs it is gaining acceptance among mainstream investors and companies, from Tesla and Mastercard to BNY Mellon. All digital coins combined have a market cap of around $1.7 trillion. \"If you really believe there\\'s a store of value in bitcoin, then there\\'s still a lot of upside,\" said John Wu, president of AVA Labs, an open-source platform for creating financial applications using blockchain technology. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \"If you look at gold, it has a market cap $9 or $10 trillion. Even if bitcoin gets to half of gold\\'s market cap, that still growth of 4X, or $200,000. So I don\\'t know when it stops rising,\" he added. Still, many analysts and investors remain skeptical of the patchily regulated and highly volatile digital asset, which is little used for commerce. Analysts at JP Morgan said bitcoin\\'s current prices were well above estimates of fair value. Mainstream adoption increases bitcoin\\'s correlation with cyclical assets, which rise and fall with economic changes, in turn reducing benefits of diversifying into crypto, the investment bank said in a memo. \"Crypto assets continue to rank as the poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities, with questionable diversification benefits at prices so far above production costs, while correlations with cyclical assets are rising as crypto ownership is mainstreamed,\" JP Morgan said. Bitcoin is an \"economic side show,\" it added, calling innovation in financial technology and the growth of digital platforms into credit and payments \"the real financial transformational story of the COVID-19 era.\" Other investors this week said bitcoin\\'s volatility presents a hurdle for it to become a widespread means of payment.
